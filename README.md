# Shared Health Plugin

## Overview
This plugin combines all players' health bars into one. Damage received from any player will be applied to all other players on the server. Healing recieved by any player will also be applied to all other players on the server. 
However, hunger remains individual to each player, and healing from saturation does not stack.

This plugin also provides an option for players to try to speedrun the game using the shared health mechanic. You must end a run using **/sh run end** before starting a new run, or else a new overworld dimension will not be created
and you will instead be teleported back to the spawnpoint of the old world.

## Commands
All commands can be found by using the **/sh** prefix (which stand for **S**hared **H**ealth).

### Run
- **/sh run start** *(requires op)* - Creates a new overworld dimension, and regenerates the nether and end dimentions. All players get teleported to the new overworld dimension where a countdown starts. (The original overworld does not get
deleted, and acts as a sort of lobby dimension where players get sent between runs).

- **/sh run end** *(requires op)* - Teleports players back to the original overworld dimension and pauses the timer.

### Timer
- **/sh timer hide** - Hides the timer for the player who used the command.

- **/sh timer show** - Shows the timer for the player who used the command.

- **/sh timer reset** *(requires op)* - Resets the timer globally.

- **/sh timer start** *(requires op)* - Starts the timer globally.

- **/sh timer pause** *(requires op)* - Pauses the timer globally.

### Attempts Counter
- **/sh attempts hide** - Hides the attempts counter for the player who used the command.

- **/sh attempts show** - Shows the attempts counter for the player who used the command.

- **/sh attempts reset** *(requires op)* - Resets the attempts counter globally.

### Debug
- **/sh debug delete-custom-world** *(requires op)* - Deletes the new overworld dimension generated by this plugin during the **/sh run start** command.

- **/sh debug logPlayerHealth** *(requires op)* - Logs all players' health to the console.

- **/sh debug showLogs <true|false>** *(requires op)* - Toggles on/off the logs generated by this plugin in the console.

- **/sh debug syncPlayerHealth** *(requires op)* - Syncs all players' health to the lowest health of everyone on the server.
