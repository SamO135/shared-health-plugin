# Shared Health Plugin

## Overview
This plugin combines all players' health bars into one. Damage received from any player will be applied to all other players on the server. Healing recieved by any player will also be applied to all other players on the server. 
However, hunger remains individual to each player, and healing from saturation does not stack.

This plugin also provides an option for players to try to speedrun the game using the shared health mechanic. You must end a run using **/sh run end** before starting a new run, or else a new overworld dimension will not be created
and you will instead be teleported back to the spawnpoint of the old world.

## Commands
All commands can be found by using the **/sh** prefix (which stand for **S**hared **H**ealth).

### Run
- **/sh run start** - Creates a new overworld dimension, and regenerates the nether and end dimentions. All players get teleported to the new overworld dimension where a countdown starts. (The original overworld does not get
deleted, and acts as a sort of lobby dimension where players get sent between runs).

- **/sh run end** - Teleports players back to the original overworld dimension and pauses the timer.

### Timer
- **/sh timer hide** - Hides the timer for the player who used the command.

- **/sh timer show** - Shows the timer for the player who used the command.

- **/sh timer reset** - Resets the timer globally.

- **/sh timer start** - Starts the timer globally.

- **/sh timer pause** - Pauses the timer globally.

### Attempts Counter
- **/sh attempts hide** - Hides the attempts counter for the player who used the command.

- **/sh attempts show** - Shows the attempts counter for the player who used the command.

- **/sh attempts reset** - Resets the attempts counter globally.

### Debug
- **/sh debug delete-custom-world** - Deletes the new overworld dimension generated by this plugin during the **/sh run start** command.

- **/sh debug logPlayerHealth** - Logs all players' health to the console.

- **/sh debug showLogs <true|false>** - Toggles on/off the logs generated by this plugin in the console.

- **/sh debug syncPlayerHealth** - Syncs all players' health to the lowest health of everyone on the server.
